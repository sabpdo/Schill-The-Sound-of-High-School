# Schill-The-Sound-of-High-School

For the HACKVH hackathon (April 2021), I along with three other teammates helped code, design, and submit this productivity website. Our project won honorable mention. For more information about what the website does, please go to this link on Devpost:https://devpost.com/software/schill-the-sound-of-high-school 

We used css, javascript, and html.
